#TODO

- free camera mouse wheel not working to zoom in/out
- free camera should pan with right mouse button drag
- add a cap to the player to know which direction they are facing
- only rotate the character based on camera in follow and 1st person camera modes
- when clicking on the camera mode buttons, set focus back to the canvas so that keyboard input works


#DONE

- add player character
- player should interact with balls and floor and walls
- add player movement controls (WASD or arrow keys) and space for jump
- allow player to throw balls with space key, longer press = farther throw, show power meter
- make balls become smaller over time and then disappear
- add 1st person/3rd person camera toggle add button on top right of ui
