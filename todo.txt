#TODO

- free camera mouse wheel not working to zoom in/out
- free camera should pan with right mouse button drag
- add a cap to the player to know which direction they are facing
- only rotate the character based on camera in follow and 1st person camera modes
- when clicking on the camera mode buttons, set focus back to the canvas so that keyboard input works
- balls are firing always away from the camera, they should fire in the direction the player is facing
- the cap is blocking the 1st persons view, in 1st person view dont render the cap

- add keys to allow user to strafe left/right without changing direction faced
- make right click on mouse drag the camera around instead of panning,
  left click should pan the camera in all modes except free camera

#DONE

- add player character
- player should interact with balls and floor and walls
- add player movement controls (WASD or arrow keys) and space for jump
- allow player to throw balls with space key, longer press = farther throw, show power meter
- make balls become smaller over time and then disappear
- add 1st person/3rd person camera toggle add button on top right of ui
